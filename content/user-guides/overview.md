# RAPIDS User Guides

The RAPIDS data science framework is a collection of libraries for running end-to-end data science pipelines completely on the GPU. The interaction is designed to have a familiar look and feel to working in Python, but utilizes optimized NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives and high-bandwidth GPU memory under the hood. Below are some links to help getting started with each of the individual RAPIDS libraries.


### <i class="fa-light fa-notebook"></i> Full Collection of each RAPIDS Library Example Notebooks with [RAPIDS Notebooks](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks)
A GitHub repository with our introductory examples of XGBoost, cuDF, cuML, cuGraph, and more.


###  <i class="fa-light fa-notebook"></i> Extended Collection of [Community Notebooks](https://github.com/rapidsai-community/notebooks-contrib)
A collection of examples and tutorials used to introduce new users to the features and capabilities of RAPIDS.


### <i class="fa-light fa-cloud"></i> Machine Learning Services Integration for [RAPIDS Cloud](https://github.com/rapidsai/cloud-ml-examples)
A repository with example notebooks and "getting started" code samples to help you integrate RAPIDS with the hyperparameter optimization services from Azure ML, AWS Sagemaker, Google Cloud, and Databricks.


### <i class="fa-light fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> Tools and Guides for [RAPIDS Deployment](/deployment/stable/)
Deployment documentation to get you up and running with RAPIDS in AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM and more. Also includes guides for HPC, HPO, Kubernetes, Dask, and more.

### <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-database"></i> ETL and Dataframe Processing with [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)
Start with the [10 Minutes to cuDF and Dask-cuDF User Guide](/api/cudf/stable/user_guide/10min/). Modeled after 10 Minutes to Pandas, this is a short introduction to cuDF that is geared mainly for new users. The [cuDF User Guide](/api/cudf/stable/user_guide/index/) is generally very extensive and helpful.


### <i class="fa-light fa-list-tree"></i> Accelerated Machine Learning with [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml)
Start with the [User Guide](/api/cuml/stable/user_guide/) and the [Estimator Intro](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/blob/branch-{{ site.data.releases.stable.version }}/docs/source/estimator_intro.ipynb), showcasing basic machine learning for training and evaluating machine learning models in cuML. The [Intro and key concepts for cuML](/api/cuml/stable/cuml_intro/) is helpful as well.


### <i class="fa-light fa-chart-network"></i> Graph Analytics with [cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph)
Start with the [Easy Path](/api/cugraph/stable/basics/nx_transition/#easy-path-use-networkx-graph-objects-accelerated-algorithms) to use NetworkX graph objects with accelerated algorithms. There is also general [cuGraph Introduction](/api/cugraph/stable/basics/cugraph_intro/).


### <i class="fa-light fa-location-crosshairs"></i> Spatial Analytics with [cuSpatial](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuspatial)
Start with the [cuSpatial User Guide](/api/cuspatial/stable/user_guide/cuspatial_api_examples/) for an intro to GPU Accelerated Spatial Analytics. The [demo notebooks](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuspatial/tree/branch-{{ site.data.releases.stable.version }}/python/cuspatial/demos) are also a good showcase.


### <i class="fa-light fa-chart-scatter-bubble"></i> Accelerated Cross-filtered Dashboards with [cuxfilter](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuxfilter)
Start with [10 Minutes to Cuxfilter](/api/cuxfilter/stable/10_minutes_to_cuxfilter/) to get an overview of how to quickly create a dashboard and [the examples section](/api/cuxfilter/stable/examples/examples/) for real dataset examples.


### <i class="fa-regular fa-signal-stream"></i> Signal Analytics with [cuSignal](https://github.com/rapidsai/cusignal)
Start with the [End to End Example](https://github.com/rapidsai/cusignal/blob/branch-{{ site.data.releases.stable.version }}/notebooks/E2E_Example.ipynb) for simulating signals and influencing guide as well as the [API Guide](https://github.com/rapidsai/cusignal/tree/branch-{{ site.data.releases.stable.version }}/notebooks/api_guide).


### <i class="fa-light fa-images"></i> Computer Vision and Analytics with [cuCIM](https://github.com/rapidsai/cucim)
Start with the [Welcome Notebook](https://github.com/rapidsai/cucim/blob/branch-{{ site.data.releases.stable.version }}/notebooks/Welcome.ipynb) for links to resources guides and a good overview of the project structure.


### <i class="fa-light fa-file-binary"></i> Algorithms and Primitives for Scientific Computing, Data Science and Machine Learning with [RAFT](https://github.com/rapidsai/raft)
Start with the [Quick Start](/api/raft/stable/quick_start/) guide for simple python and C++ examples.


### <i class="fa-light fa-bolt"></i> Accelerated Apache Spark with [Spark RAPIDS](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/)
Start with [the Examples Repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids-examples) for Spark related utilities and examples using the RAPIDS Accelerator, including ETL, ML/DL, and more. A good [overview](https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/) is available on their docs introduction.
