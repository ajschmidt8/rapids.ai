## CHECK IT OUT!!!

This is a demo of the proxied documentation for each library.

Current `legacy`, `stable`, `nightly` docs are all available through convenient URLs (e.g. [/docs/cudf/legacy/](/docs/cudf/legacy/)).

Any old documentation versions in our S3 bucket are also available via permanent versioned links (e.g. [/docs/cudf/23.02/](/docs/cudf/23.02/)).
